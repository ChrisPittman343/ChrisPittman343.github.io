This is a minesweeper remake, programmed in React.

One key difference between this and the real thing is that all mines must be flagged to win. This can be done by right clicking a node.

As an addition, this program has a built in solving algorithm should you get bored while playing. Just press the button with a robot on it to begin. Once the algorithm has started, it cannot be stopped (Unless it gets stuck due to a forced 50/50 guess).
