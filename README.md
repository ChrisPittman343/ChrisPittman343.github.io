This is a minesweeper remake, programmed in React.

By no means is this optimal, but it works for the most part.

One key difference between this and the real thing is that all mines must be flagged to win. This can be done by right clicking a node.

As an addition, this program has a built in solving algorithm should you get bored while playing. Just press the button with a robot on it to begin. Once the algorithm has started, it cannot be stopped (Unless it gets stuck due to a forced 50/50 guess).
